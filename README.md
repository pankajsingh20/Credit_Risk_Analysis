# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Power BI credit risk analysis project featuring DAX calculations, visualizations, segmentation, time series analysis, and dashboard creation.

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI project focused on credit risk analysis using real-world financial data. The project demonstrates key techniques such as DAX calculations for metrics like average loan amounts and interest rates, and visualizing loan statuses by employment length and home ownership. Additionally, it includes segmentation analysis by loan intent, time series analysis of default rates, and scenario simulations using a 'What-if Parameter' for interest rate changes. Advanced DAX formulas are used to calculate risk scores, and Row Level Security (RLS) is implemented for data protection. The project culminates in a complete dashboard published via Power BI Service.
